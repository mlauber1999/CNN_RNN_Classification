# CNN_RNN_Classification
Mini project experimenting with CNN and RNN classification models on tinyImageNet dataset.  


In this project, I examine how the classification accuracy of pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) and reccurent neural network (RNN) models is affected by model size and architecural complexity.

The models (from large to small) were as follows:

1. Visual Geometry Group 19 (VGG19) vs. VGG11
   [Very Deep Convolutional Networks for Large-Scale Image Recognition (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)

3. Residual Neural Network 50 (ResNet50) vs. ResNet18
4. Inception-V4 vs. Inception-V3
