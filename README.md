# CNN_RNN_Classification
Mini project experimenting with CNN and RNN classification models on tinyImageNet dataset.  


In this project, I examine how the classification accuracy of pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) and reccurent neural network (RNN) models is affected by model size and architecural complexity.

The models (from small to large) were as follows:

1. Visual Geometry Group 11 (VGG11) vs. VGG19
   [(Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556)

3. Residual Neural Network 18 (ResNet18) vs. ResNet50
   [(He et al., 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)

4. Inception-V3 vs. Inception-V4
   [(Szegedy et al., 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567)
